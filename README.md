### Task: Copy/Paste table column

Clone and paste element to document... Easy? Okay, but what do you say when I will say you have to clone and paste table column? This task is for real heroes!

Your task: Clone the second column from the table, and append it to the table. To increase the complexity, append it in front of the last table column.

It's the start table:

In this task, you have not any steps. But have some hints to do this task:
- JavaScript document has methods for work with tables. [Theory Tables](https://javascript.info/dom-navigation#dom-navigation-tables)
- For beginning review the table structure
- Remember that in this task HTML table has `tbody`, `thead`, `tfoot` sections.
- Try the first append column to the end of the table.

You no need to change styles or HTML layout in this task. Change only `main.js` file.
