In this task, we don't provide details instructions. But below are some hints how to do this task:
- JavaScript document has methods to work with tables. [Theory tables](https://javascript.info/dom-navigation#dom-navigation-tables) 
- Before you start review the table structure
- Remember that in this task HTML table has `tbody`, `thead`, `tfoot` sections.
- As a first step try to append first column to the end of the table.

You don't need to change styles or HTML layout in this task. Change only `main.js` file.
